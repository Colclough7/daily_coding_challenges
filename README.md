# Daily Coding Challenges :brain: :muscle:
### This repository is just where I collect my daily coding challenge solutions.

## :raised_eyebrow: Why????

 I do daily challenges for a few reasons:
- I love a great challenge
- **Perfect** practice, makes perfect
- What better way to deepen my understanding of the language than to use it? 
- I love competition

## :notebook: Some Notes 
At the moment all the challenges here are Codewars katas. I keep note of their names and their instructions. But if you want to work on the same kata as yours truly heres a link to my [profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/Colclough7/completed).

I love friendly competition, so if you want to crush me on the leaderboard, feel free to follow me on there and let me know so I can follow you back.

These challenges are a study tool for me, so you'll likely see a lot of repetition of the same challenge. I do this so that I can practice with different methods, or sometimes just for kicks.
