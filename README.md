# Daily Coding Challenges :brain: :muscle:
### This repository is just where I collect my daily coding challenge solutions.

## :raised_eyebrow: Why????

# I do daily challenges for a few reasons:
- I love a great challenge
- **Perfect** practice, makes perfect
- What better way to deepen my understanding of the language than to use it? 
- I love competition
